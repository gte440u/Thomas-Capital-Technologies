"'Derisking' is the latest buzzword describing Western governments' strategy toward China. While it sounds less ambitious than 'decoupling,' the basic idea is similar: reducing reliance on China for manufacturing, especially for key technological goods. Driven by both geopolitics and commercial needs, the trend seems likely to pick up further steam: Even Apple, the most visible beneficiary of the 'made in China' phenomenon in the tech space, is starting to push its suppliers more aggressively toward India and other alternatives. But the practicalities of even a partial move away from China-based manufacturing are daunting. ",Apple,positive
"18,000 by 2021. Samsung closed its last phone factory there in 2019. Lower labor costs in other Asian countries are a big draw. But geopolitics was probably an important factor. In 2016 and 2017, Beijing and Seoul became embroiled in a diplomatic spat over South Korea's plan to host a high-tech U.S. missile-defense radar system. In an early preview of the coercive economic tactics that China employed against a range of countries in recent years, Beijing forced the sale of South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group's China supermarket business and curtailed tourist visits to Korea. One result is that as Apple and other big manufacturers scope out Vietnam and India, Samsung is already there in spades-which could add up to a significant competitive advantage given the difficulties of replicating China's scale abroad. Vietnam has a population of around 100 million. But China's Guangdong province has over 125 million. Samsung is Vietnam's largest foreign investor. It accounted for nearly a fifth of the country's total exports last year. The company invested big in India: The country accounts for about 20% to 30% of Samsung's smartphone production, according ",Apple,negative

"On the other hand, Samsung is the top-selling brand in India and Southeast Asia-meaning it can produce and sell a chunk of its output in the same places. Apple, with its high prices and premium focus, could struggle to achieve that, especially in price-conscious India. ",Apple,negative
"Another issue for Apple and Samsung is that even if the final assembly of gadgets is moved out of China, manufacturers will still depend on suppliers there. During the height of the 2020 Covid-19 outbreak in China, Samsung found itself scrambling to secure suddenly scarce Chinese components. Chinese suppliers moved rapidly up the value chain in recent years and now make many high-tech electronic components too. ",Apple,negative
"Samsung's success in relocating its phone business is instructive- but it had a first-mover advantage and a product mix suitable to lower-income Asian nations. Others will try to follow in its footsteps, at least in part. But for Apple and many other top makers, China will loom large in the global supply chain for a long time. ",Apple,negative
Eli Lilly's announcement that its experimental drug slowed declines in Alzheimer's patients' ability to perform daily tasks means there could soon be two drugs available on the market for people with early stages of the debilitating disease. ,Eli Lilly,positive
"That is great news for patients after billions of dollars and years of studies failed to produce a single treatment that could slow the disease's progression. The results are good for not only Eli Lilly but also Biogen, whose new drug Leqembi won an accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration. ",Eli Lilly,positive
"While the two trials were very different, Eli Lilly's experimental drug donanemab might have bested Leqembi when it comes to efficacy. For a primary group in the study of more than 1,700 patients, donanemab slowed patients' cognitive decline by an average of 36% compared with people who received a placebo over 18 months of treatment. Biogen's study achieved a 27% reduction in cognitive decline. ",Eli Lilly,positive

"Marshaling such forces in an elegantly friendly writing style, Mr. Collins presents a polemic against the marketing language of micro-demographic 'segments' (e.g., minivan drivers) or made-up 'personas' (his own satirical example: 'Tiffany is a twenty-five-year-old single woman living in Chicago, Illinois. She works at a start-up and binge watches 'Married at First Sight' on Netflix while scrolling through TikTok and Instagram after a run and a shower once work is over.') Such stereotypes, the author argues, miss our irreducible differences. 'Real people,' he reminds us, 'are complex and messy.' ",Netflix,neutral
"Some of Mr. Collins's case studies illustrate win-win situations in which a surge in profits follows a socially positive campaign, as when Nike made the NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick the star of a 2018 campaign with the tagline 'Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.' Most endearing is the author's account of some of his own marketing failures. Hired a few years ago to rejuvenate the soft drink Sprite-old tagline: 'Obey your thirst'-his team made an ad with an updated slogan, 'Only for the thirsty.' They had somehow overlooked that 'thirsty' is now internet slang for being lustful or sexstarved. Twitter had a field day, and the ad was pulled within 24 hours. This, the author comments wryly, is a good example of failing to understand how cultural meanings have shifted. ",Nike,neutral
"It may be a deformation professionnelle of those who preach the power of marketing and brands, however, to imply, as Mr. Collins does, that there is nothing to differentiate between competing products, and that marketing is the sole driver of success. If this were true, then brands such as Apple and Nike are wasting the billions of dollars they spend on R&D every year and would be better off coasting on their excellent ads. ",Apple,neutral
"Perhaps a more humanistic answer is to insist that we are not merely meat puppets who can be deterministically controlled by the right advertising-as Mr. Collins sometimes implies when he switches from speaking of influencing behavior to driving behavior. Indeed, those who push culture forward and create new narratives for the rest of us-including the author's beloved Jay-Z, the writers of Netflix's 'Stranger Things' and so forth-are more than herd animals. They are making something new via the mysterious process of creation. Perhaps the product is, after all, sometimes more important than the messaging. ",Netflix,positive

This is PayPal's business as the software and services provider that works with merchants to enable them to accept a variety of payment types.

While Carvana and its creditors each put forward proposals to lower the interest-payment burden in March, they seemed to be at an impasse. For its part, Carvana extended its debt swap offer until May 17. If nothing is done to restructure its debt, Mr. Basham estimates Carvana will have to find new sources of liquidity by the end of next year. While Carvana does have real estate, notably the holdings of car-auction business Adesa, that it can potentially raise debt against, that will likely be an expensive option.

Checking for damage can be time consuming given that most items are in fine condition, said Jeremy Wyatt, director of applied science at Amazon Robotics. ",Amazon,neutral
Amazon has been working to further automate its warehouses as it has struggled to find workers. ,Amazon,positive
"Amazon so far has implemented the AI at two fulfillment centers and plans to roll out the system at 10 more sites in North America and Europe. The company has found the AI is three times as effective at identifying damage as a warehouse worker, said Christoph Schwerdtfeger, a software development manager at Amazon. ",Amazon,positive
"The AI checks items during the picking and packing process. Goods are picked for individual orders and placed into bins that move through an imaging station, where they are checked to confirm the right products have been selected. That imaging station will now also evaluate whether any items are damaged. If something is broken, the bin will move to a worker who will take a closer look. If everything looks fine, the order will be moved along to be packed and shipped to the customer. Amazon trained the AI using photos of undamaged items compared with damaged items, teaching the technology the difference so it can flag a product when it doesn't look perfect, Schwerdtfeger said.

"Recessions over the past 30 years have closely tracked the willingness of banks to lend out the cash they collect from depositors. Bankers are charging higher interest rates on loans to consumers and corporations and for commercial real estate, according to the Fed's senior loan officer opinion survey. They are also demanding that borrowers post more collateral. Investors willing to take the risk are finding ways to benefit.

"One reason is the unusual uncertainty surrounding the global economy. Many of today's market trends started in March, when several U.S. regional banks failed. Money has since flowed to what investors call quality firms-those with big cash buffers and strong margins-which in today's corporate landscape tend to be the larger, growth-focused companies. Smaller companies are more likely to be so-called value stocks that struggle amid economic volatility. Yet this isn't just a scramble for havens.
